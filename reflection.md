I developed this portfolio site with early 90's site style in mind. It had to include all of the tacky elements including gifs, img texts, and table structures. The biggest challenged I faced was organizing the tables and their contents to my liking so that each page had a decent navbar with a main content area, containing side panels for some goofy gifs. I solved this issue by making the borders visible and arranging the row and cols, adjusting their widths, experimenting with other attributes, and adding separate table tags for the sole purpose of adding title sections.
